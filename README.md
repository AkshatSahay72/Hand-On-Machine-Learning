# Hand-On Machine Learning: My ML Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning journal!  
This repository documents my progress and hands-on experiments as I study *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*.

## ðŸŒŸ About This Repository

This repo serves as a living **journal** of my learning journey in Machine Learning (ML).  
It contains my annotated code, experiments, and notes as I follow along with the *Hands-On Machine Learning* book.  
You'll find practical examples, exercises, and personal insights reflecting my understanding and challenges throughout each chapter.

## ðŸ“š Current Progress

- **Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape**
  - Introduces basic concepts, types of ML systems, and real-world applications.
  - My focus: Understanding supervised vs. unsupervised learning, and key ML challenges.

- **Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project**
  - Builds a complete ML workflow, from data collection to model evaluation.
  - My hands-on: Tried a housing price prediction project, including data cleaning, visualization, and model deployment.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Journal?

- To reinforce and track my ML growth.
- To keep a transparent, reproducible record of projects and ideas.
- To share practical code and notes with others learning from the same book.

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Repo

- Browse the Jupyter Notebooks for chapter-wise walkthroughs.
- Peek into `/datasets/` used in notebooks.
- Use the code and commentary as reference for your own ML journey or for collaborative learning!

## ðŸ“… What's Next?

Iâ€™ll keep updating this repo as I continue each chapterâ€”stay tuned!
